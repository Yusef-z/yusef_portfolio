                                and also has a dictionary which contains detailed translation of any given work in multiple sign language systems.
                                <br>the data used in this application was scraped from the website "spreadthesign.com" and then uploaded to firebase firestore so that it can be used in flutter

                                <br>also the application will show similar movies in case the returned movie doesn't intreset the user.
                                 <br>also users can keep track of their watched movies/shows so that they won't appear in the search.
                                <br>the application relies on the TMDB api to get the data
